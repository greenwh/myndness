## CBT Tools

### Thought Records

**Purpose**: Challenge unhelpful thinking patterns using cognitive restructuring

**When to use**: When you notice distressing thoughts or strong emotions

**7-Step Process**:

1. **Situation**: What happened? (When, where, who)
   - Be specific: "During video call with my doctor at 2pm"

2. **Automatic Thought**: What went through your mind?
   - The first thought that popped up: "I'm going to say something stupid"

3. **Emotion**: What did you feel?
   - Select emotion and rate intensity (0-100)
   - Can rate multiple emotions

4. **Distortions**: What thinking traps are present?
   - Select from list of cognitive distortions
   - Reference guide available in CBT hub

5. **Evidence For & Against**:
   - **For**: Facts supporting the thought
   - **Against**: Facts contradicting the thought

6. **Balanced Thought**: Create a more realistic perspective
   - Consider all evidence
   - What would you tell a friend?

7. **Outcome**: How do you feel now?
   - Rate emotion intensity after this exercise
   - Notice the change

**Auto-save**: Your progress saves automatically every 500ms. You can exit and return anytime.

**View history**: Tools → CBT → View History
- See all completed records
- Resume incomplete drafts
- Filter by date range

### Cognitive Distortions Reference

**Purpose**: Learn to recognize thinking traps

**Common distortions**:
- **All-or-Nothing**: Seeing things as black and white
- **Overgeneralization**: One event means it always happens
- **Mental Filter**: Focusing only on negatives
- **Mind Reading**: Assuming you know what others think
- **Fortune Telling**: Predicting negative outcomes
- **Catastrophizing**: Expecting the worst-case scenario
- **Emotional Reasoning**: "I feel it, so it must be true"
- **Should Statements**: Rigid rules about how things "should" be
- **Labeling**: Defining yourself by one characteristic
- **Personalization**: Blaming yourself for things outside your control

**How to access**: Tools → CBT → Thinking Traps Guide

### Behavioral Experiments

**Purpose**: Test anxiety-provoking beliefs with real-world evidence

**When to use**: When you have a specific belief you want to challenge

**4-Step Setup**:

1. **Identify Belief**: What do you believe will happen?
   - Example: "If I call my doctor, I'll sound stupid"
   - Rate belief strength: 0-100

2. **Design Experiment**: What will you do to test this?
   - Example: "Call doctor's office to schedule appointment"
   - Be specific and safe

3. **Make Prediction**: What do you think will happen?
   - Example: "I'll stumble over words and they'll think I'm incompetent"
   - Rate confidence: 0-100

4. **Schedule** (optional): When will you do this?
   - Set a date
   - Link to a planned activity if relevant

**After Completing**:
1. Open incomplete experiment
2. **Record what actually happened**
3. **Note what you learned**
4. **Re-rate belief strength** - Notice if it changed
5. View before → after comparison

**Why it works**: Direct evidence is more powerful than thought alone. Most predictions turn out to be inaccurate.

### Anxiety Hierarchy (Exposure Therapy)

**Purpose**: Gradually face fears through systematic desensitization

**When to use**: For persistent fears or phobias you want to overcome

**Getting Started**:

**Step 1: Build Your Ladder** (lowest to highest anxiety)

1. Go to Tools → CBT → Anxiety Hierarchy
2. Click **"Add New Fear"**
3. **Describe situation**: Be specific
4. **Category** (optional): Social, Health, Performance, etc.
5. **Rate current distress**: SUDS 0-100
   - SUDS = Subjective Units of Distress Scale
   - 0 = No distress at all
   - 50 = Moderate distress
   - 100 = Extreme distress
6. **Set target**: How low do you want to get?
   - Suggested: 30 points below current
   - Don't need to reach 0 - just manageable

**Step 2: Face Each Fear Repeatedly**

1. Click on an item from your list
2. Click **"Log New Exposure"**
3. **Before**: Rate anxiety before starting (pre-filled with current level)
4. **Do the exposure** - Face the feared situation
5. **During**: What was your peak anxiety during?
6. **After**: Rate anxiety after completing
7. **Duration**: How long (in minutes)
8. **Notes** (optional): What did you notice?
9. **Save** - Your distress chart updates

**Step 3: Track Habituation**

- **View progress chart**: Shows distress over time
  - Blue line = Before each exposure
  - Orange line = During (peak)
  - Green line = After
  - Dashed line = Your target
- **Notice the trend**: After line should decrease over multiple exposures
- **Mark complete**: When you reach your target distress level

**Tips for success**:
- Start with lower-anxiety items first
- Repeat each exposure 5-10 times before moving up
- Stay in the situation until anxiety decreases (don't escape at peak)
- Shorter, frequent exposures work better than one long exposure

## Tips for Success

### For ADHD

✓ **Start small**: Don't plan 10 activities on day one
✓ **Use auto-save**: Every form saves automatically - no pressure
✓ **Set timers**: Meditation and breathing are timed for you
✓ **Exit anytime**: You can always come back to finish later
✓ **Visual cues**: Color-coded distress levels, progress bars
✓ **Structure**: Daily planner provides routine and predictability

### For Anxiety

✓ **Crisis tools first**: Bookmark breathing/grounding for quick access
✓ **Track patterns**: Insights reveal anxiety triggers
✓ **Start hierarchy low**: Begin with easiest fears first
✓ **Celebrate small wins**: Every exposure is progress
✓ **Body awareness**: Body scan helps release physical tension
✓ **Challenge thoughts**: Thought records reduce rumination

### For Depression

✓ **Behavioral activation**: Complete activities even when unmotivated
✓ **Low barrier**: Activities have short durations, low effort options
✓ **Track mood**: See small improvements you might not notice
✓ **No guilt language**: App never says "you should" or "you failed"
✓ **Movement helps**: Even 5-minute stretch counts
✓ **Experiments**: Test beliefs like "nothing will help"

### General Best Practices

**Daily Routine**:
1. Morning: Check planned activities, log mood
2. Midday: Complete activities, use breathing if needed
3. Evening: Log mood again, review completed activities
4. Weekly: Check insights, adjust plans based on patterns

**Consistency > Perfection**:
- Log mood 3x/week is better than aiming for 3x/day and quitting
- 3-minute meditation is better than skipping because you "should" do 20
- One thought record per week adds up to 52 per year

**Use What Helps**:
- You don't need to use every feature
- Focus on 2-3 tools that work for you
- Return to other features when ready

**Share with Providers**:
- Export data to share with therapist
